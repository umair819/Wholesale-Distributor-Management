## 📋 Project Overview

Pakistan mein thousands of wholesalers aur distributors hain jo FMCG, medicines, electronics,
groceries, textiles distribute karte hain. Inhe chahiye:
- Party-wise ledger (Bahi Khata digitally)
- Sale order + delivery challan + invoice
- Recovery tracking (unka paisah kab milega)
- Salesman / area management
- WhatsApp pe outstanding remind karo

PharmaPOS ki medicines import logic + General Store POS ka inventory logic combine kar ke
yeh ek powerful distribution management system ban sakta hai.

## 📝 Notes & Ideas

- Naam rakhein: **DistributorPak** ya **TajirPro** ya **WholesalePro**
- PharmaPOS ki medicines CSV import logic yahan directly reuse karo
- Pakistan mein FMCG distribution = biggest market (Unilever, P&G distributors)
- Medicines distributor = PharmaPOS + yeh system = lethal combination
- Salesman mobile web app (PWA) — Phase 2 mein salesman field se order enter kare
- Highest ticket price product — Rs. 50,000-75,000 enterprise easily milega

## 🔐 Final Phase: Security & Licensing System (Launch Se Pehle Lazim)

> **Is phase ko complete kiye baghair software sell nahi karna!**
> **Note:** SmartFlow/Fleet jaisi same Node.js architecture.

### Steps:

#### Step 1 — PC ID Generation (Node.js)
- [ ] `node-machine-id` → SHA256 → PC ID
- [ ] Salesman count limit enforce karo (1 user, 3 users, unlimited)

#### Step 2 — Trial (Server-Side, 15 days)
- [ ] "Trial — X days, 1 salesman only"
- [ ] Server pe track, file nahi

#### Step 3 — License Activation
- [ ] `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` key (Small/Medium/Large)
- [ ] `POST /api/activate` → `{key, pc_id, salesman_count}` → encrypted save

#### Step 4 — Startup Validation
- [ ] PC ID + salesman count enforce + expiry
- [ ] Har 3 din online + 7-din offline grace

#### Step 5 — Deactivation + Lock
#### Step 6 — Code Protection (JS obfuscator + Electron)
#### Step 7 — Admin License Panel (salesman count track)

### Phase Table:
| Phase | Tasks | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 8 | PC ID + Trial (1 salesman limit) | 🔴 Not Started |
